# Jekyll Documentation (Book Edition)

by Tom Preston-Werner, Nick Quaranto, Parker Moore, et al


> **Note:** The book edition is still an early release and a work-in-progess.


This is the [(official) documentation](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/tree/master/site/_docs)
for the Jekyll static site builder / generator
reformatted in a single-page book edition.

See the [source repo](https://github.com/hydepress/hydepress.github.io) for how
the book gets auto-built with "plain" Jekyll - of course - and hosted on GitHub Pages.
